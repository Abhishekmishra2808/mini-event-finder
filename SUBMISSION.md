### Code Quality Highlights

1. **TypeScript Throughout**
   - Strict type checking enabled
   - Shared type definitions between frontend/backend
   - Proper interface definitions for all data structures
   - Type-safe API calls and responses

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Reusable components (EventCard, SaveEventButton, etc.)
   - Custom hooks for state management
   - Proper props typing

3. **State Management**
   - React Query for server state (caching, invalidation)
   - Local state for UI interactions
   - LocalStorage for persistence (saved events, drafts)
   - Proper loading and error states

4. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks for async operations
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Graceful degradation

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - React Query caching (5-minute stale time)
   - Debounced location search (500ms)
   - Lazy loading with skeleton states
   - Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays

6. **Clean Code Practices**
   - Consistent naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
   - Meaningful variable and function names
   - Modular, DRY code
   - Comments for complex logic
   - No console errors or warnings

## 🎯 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Routing Issues in Production
**Problem**: Event detail pages showed 404 errors intermittently after deployment. Sometimes clicking an event card worked, sometimes it didn't.

**Root Cause**: 
- Nested `<Link>` components in EventCard (outer card + inner "Join Event" button)
- `stopPropagation()` preventing outer link navigation
- No retry logic for failed API calls

**Solution**:
- Removed nested Links - single Link wrapper for entire card
- Added 3 automatic retries with exponential backoff in React Query
- Added comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Implemented proper Vercel routing configuration (rewrites to index.html)

**Result**: 100% reliable navigation with better error recovery.

---

### Challenge 2: Location Search Performance
**Problem**: Location autocomplete caused too many API requests, slowing down the UI.

**Solution**:
- Implemented 500ms debouncing using `setTimeout`
- Added minimum 3-character requirement before search
- Limited results to 5 suggestions
- Added loading indicator during search
- Cached coordinates in form state

**Result**: Smooth, responsive location search with minimal API calls.

---

### Challenge 3: GPS Button User Feedback
**Problem**: GPS location detection took 3-5 seconds with no visual feedback, making users think the button wasn't working.

**Solution**:
- Added `isGettingLocation` state variable
- Implemented loading state with spinner animation
- Changed button text to "Getting..." during fetch
- Disabled button during loading to prevent double-clicks
- Added cursor-wait and opacity changes

**Result**: Clear visual feedback, better perceived performance.

---

### Challenge 4: Serverless Function Deployment
**Problem**: Backend showed "Cannot GET /" on Vercel - standard Express app structure doesn't work with serverless.

**Solution**:
- Created `api/index.ts` as serverless entry point
- Exported Express app as default export
- Updated `vercel.json` to route all requests to serverless function
- Added root route with API information
- Configured proper CORS for Vercel domains

**Result**: Seamless serverless deployment with proper routing.

---

### Challenge 5: Category Widget Height Mismatch
**Problem**: Vertical categories widget was too tall compared to the search section on the left.

**Solution**:
- Transformed vertical widget to horizontal pill filters
- Implemented active/inactive/hover states with gradients
- Made it full-width and responsive with flex-wrap
- Added smooth transitions between states

**Result**: Modern, space-efficient design that scales better.

   - Extended with additional fields (category, tags, distanceInKm)
   - Ensured type safety across frontend/backend
   - **Result**: Caught type errors before runtime

3. **Haversine Formula Implementation**
   - AI provided the mathematical implementation
   - Understood the formula: `a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos φ1 * cos φ2 * sin²(Δλ/2)`
   - Added proper TypeScript types
   - Tested with known coordinates
   - **Result**: Accurate distance calculations verified against Google Maps

4. **React Query Setup**
   - AI suggested React Query for server state
   - Customized caching strategy (5-min stale time)
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - **Result**: Professional data fetching with caching

5. **Vercel Deployment Configuration**
   - AI provided initial `vercel.json` structure
   - Modified for serverless function routing
   - Added SPA rewrites for client-side routing
   - Configured environment variables
   - **Result**: Successful deployment with proper routing

### Not Just Copy-Paste
