**Why**: Never miss an event - get timely alerts before it starts

### 4. **Similar Events Discovery**
**What**: AI-powered suggestions showing related events based on category and location  
**Why**: Discover more events you might like based on your interests


### 5. **Location Autocomplete**
**What**: Smart location search with real-time suggestions from OpenStreetMap Nominatim  
**Why**: Faster, error-free event creation with accurate coordinates


### 6. **Mobile Responsiveness**

##  How I Leveraged AI Tools

### **GitHub Copilot** (Primary Tool - 70% of development)
- **Component scaffolding**: Generated initial React component structures
- **TypeScript types**: Suggested interfaces and type definitions
- **API integration**: Helped with axios setup and React Query configuration
- **Boilerplate code**: Auto-completed repetitive patterns (event cards, forms)

### **ChatGPT/Claude** (Complex Problem Solving - 20%)
- **Haversine formula**: Explained and implemented distance calculation algorithm
- **Vercel deployment**: Solved serverless function configuration issues
- **React Query setup**: Optimized caching and retry strategies
- **Bug fixes**: Debugged routing issues and nested Link problems

### **AI-Powered Search** (Documentation - 10%)
- **Library docs**: Quick lookups for React Router, Tailwind CSS
- **API references**: Open-Meteo, Nominatim integration guides
- **Best practices**: TypeScript patterns, React performance tips

###  **Time Saved**
- **Traditional approach**: Would take 20-25 hours
- **With AI assistance**: Completed in **less than 8 hours**
- **Time saved**: ~15-17 hours (70% faster development)


###  **Important Note**
**AI was a tool, not a replacement for thinking:**
- Every line of AI-generated code was reviewed and understood
- Custom features (weather, reminders, saved events) required human creativity
- Business logic and UX decisions were manual
- Debugging and optimization required human problem-solving
- AI suggested 60-70% of the code; humans refined it to production quality
